♣ 3 - Children. Estimate, by simulation, the average number of children there would be in a family if
all people had children until they had a boy. Do the same if all people had children until they had at
least one boy and at least one girl. How many more children would you expect to find under the second
scheme than under the first in 106
families? (Assume that boys and girls are equally likely.)


♣ 4 - Matching Cards. Take two identical decks of cards, each deck containing m cards. (For example,
from a standard deck of cards, use the 13 spades as one deck and the 13 hearts as the other deck.) Shuffle
each of the decks and determine if at least one match has occurred by comparing the positions of the
cards in the decks. If a match occurs at one or more than one position, call the trial a success. Thus, each
experiment consists of comparing the positions of the m cards in each of the two decks. The outcome
of the experiment is ”success” if at least one match occurs, ”failure” if no matches occur. Simulate this
experiment on the computer using permutations of the first m positive integers. For example, for m = 6,
you could randomly order 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6 (by using randperm(6)) and if any of these integers occupies its
natural position, a match occurs. For each of m = 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, repeat the simulation 1000 times
and calculate the relative frequency of success
